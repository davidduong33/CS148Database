            <h3>Welcome To Our Shoe Inventory</h3>
            <p>This site was designed to help sneaker heads keep track of their shoes. With so many excellent
            shoes out there, it is so hard to keep track of which ones you have or don't have, especially if you have
            money like professional athletes. Some people have a closet full of shoes, some have garages or separate houses
            for them. Others, like myself, just have the lower shoe rack to show for my sneaker collection. 
            Regardless of your situation, it is always a good idea to keep track of your kicks.</p>
